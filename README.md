#  Machine Learning Project: "Censored Bayesian Polynomial Regression"

A term project for the course [CS-E4820 - Machine Learning: Advanced Probabilistic Methods](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=13087) at Aalto University,
taught in spring 2017. The goal of the project was to construct a
Bayesian regression model for incomplete censored data. We considered polynomial regression
and used the EM algorithm to obtain a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate for the parameters
of the model. We used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the degree of the polynomial.
Implemented in MATLAB.
